# This is a short config file for testing the injection of ngmix catalog objects into existing fits
# images as part of the Y3 Balrog pipeline. No promises are made (yet) for its completeness or
# working state!
#
# Balrog yaml files are slightly different than their normal GalSim counterparts. It cannot be run
# with a standard galsim executable of the form `galsim balrog_config.yaml`; instead, it is passed
# as an input to the python script `balrog_injection.py`. This serves as the base of a multi-output
# yaml file that all of the individual chip simulations will inherit from. Do not set any fields or
# variables here that are not universal.
